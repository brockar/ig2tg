```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/brockar/ig2tg.git
    cd ig2tg
    ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

    Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```

    Edit `.env` and set:
    - `IG_USERNAME` and `IG_PASSWORD` (or `IGSESSIONID` and `IGCSRFTOKEN` for session login) (works with 2FAs)
    - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` (your Telegram bot token) and `TG_USER` to just send images to your telegram user.

    **How to get Instagram session cookies:**
    1. Go to [instagram.com](https://instagram.com) and log in.
    2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect).
    3. Go to the "Application" tab, then "Cookies".
    4. Copy the values for `sessionid` (set as `IGSESSIONID`) and `csrftoken` (set as `IGCSRFTOKEN`).

3. **Add Instagram usernames to monitor:**

    Create a file named `user_list.txt` in the project root and add one Instagram username per line (no `@`):

    ```
    testuser1
    testuser2
    ```

    Also can add comments with `#`
